# Opencam

This project is to hopefully start by gaining access to cheap chinese cameras that tend to have little to no support and run things like 'flash' and cant be updated due to lack of firmware. 
Once access is gained the next step is to copy and deconstruct the firmware, in the hope we can write our own firmware that provides a simple interface with consistant endpoints. 
Ideally the camera will povide two streams 1 and 2 so as to allow a high def stream for viewing and a low def one for processing / thumbnailing.
